## Inspiration
Renewable energy is the future, but there are multiple hurdles that prevent organizations and individuals from the successful transition to a fully renewable source. Our platform aims to remove those limitations and provide guidance throughout the entire transition process.

## What it does
EnerGeo is an app designed to calculate the optimal type of renewable energy and associated costs with your preferred location. Enter your zip code for solar and wind power cost estimates compared to your current costs.

## How we built it
EnerGeo was built primarily with JavaScript and Python, utilizing the Google Cloud Platform and Flask.

## Challenges we ran into
The main challenge we ran into was the integration of the front-end and the back-end because full-stack web development was a new concept for our team.

## What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned a lot about the harnessing of renewable resources as well as the hurdles consumers may face as they try to embrace the renewable energy future.

On the software development side, we learned a lot about using the Google Cloud Platform, data analysis, and using different APIs to gather data.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of our front-end and our pixel-perfect user experience. We are also very proud of the data analysis we did in the back-end because we learned a lot throughout the process of building it.
